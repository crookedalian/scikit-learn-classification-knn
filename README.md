Scikit-Learn Classification Project
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a classification problem using the Scikit-Learn library in Python. The project utilizes a heart disease dataset to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes.

Files
scikit-learn-classification.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook file that includes the entire workflow from loading the data, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
heart-disease.csv: The dataset used in this project, containing medical data related to heart disease.
Project Steps
Data Loading: Load the heart disease dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.
Data Preparation: Split the data into features and target variables, and further split it into training and testing sets.
Model Creation: Create a machine learning pipeline using StandardScaler for feature scaling and KNeighborsClassifier for the KNN algorithm.
Model Training: Train the model using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
